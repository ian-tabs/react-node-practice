# React-Node-Practice
React-Node-Practice is my playground for practicing and prototyping projects based on React and Node. The repository currently contains two pages when ran:

## InfiniteTable
InfiniteTable is a simple application that utilizes the Open Library API to test out infinite loading. The Open Library API used in this project is "https://openlibrary.org/search.json".

### Usage
To use InfiniteTable, simply type in anything you want to search in the search bar.

## RandomNodeTrials
RandomNodeTrials is a page where I tested out how to set up a Node server. It currently has some dummy data from test routes that have been set up. The main focus of this page was on setting up server routes dynamically instead of functional APIs. Currently, the only available APIs are "greet" and "fakeUsers".

### Usage
To see RandomNodeTrials in action, make sure to start the server locally via npm run start on the backend folder.

### Additional Notes
Please review the source code in the backend folder on how to set up the server routes dynamically as it may provide helpful insights into creating your own Node server.

### Support
If you encounter any issues while using this repository or have any questions, please open an issue on the repository.

Thank you for your interest in React-Node-Practice!
